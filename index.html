            <p>
                “Full disclosure: I am a geek. I love computers. I love everything about them. I spend eight to ten hours a day in front of a 
                computer screen as I am coding, debugging, or discussing coding practices and methods with other programmers. When I am not programming,
                 I am teaching about computers at the university or am researching and writing about computers as part of my academic work. 
                 I truly get excited when a new kernel of Linux is released or when a new Web application that does something never done before becomes
                  available for beta testing. I am deeply impressed when I see smart and beautiful code that does something I know is hard to accomplish.
                   These are moments when I feel that we have only touched the surface of what we can do with computers, and I know that there is a simple
                    solution to the current programming problem I am facing;I just need to get my head around it. With my spare time, I play around with my 
                    operating system, trying out new ideas or writing a patch or a bug report to some open source application I use. Most of my day has 
                something to do with computers, until, of course, my son barges into my office and demands we play a “real game”, outside!”

                    At times, it can be frustrating having to deal with customers. However, many developers report getting a boost
                     in morale when dealing with end users. They can see close up how customers are using their products and get 
                     real feedback from those who use products on a daily basis. Seeing how their work is being used gives them
                      motivation to ‘do better’.  For example, when rolling out software it can be useful to involve a developer
                       in customer support and use their expertise to spot issues ‘on the hoof’.</p>
